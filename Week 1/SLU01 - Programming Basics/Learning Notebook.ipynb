The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely distributed. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability. For these and other reasons, it became a wildly popular language."

Stack Overflow is a pretty popular website with Q&A on a lot of programming languages. When searching for a question in the question bar you can use a Python tag [Python] or [python-3.x] to avoid similar questions about another language.
